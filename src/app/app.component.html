<h2>Why angular ?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>2-way-data-binding</h2>
    <p class="angular_features">
      Two-way binding means that any data-related changes affecting the model are immediately propagated to the matching view(s), and that any changes made in the view(s) (say, by the user) are immediately reflected in the underlying model. When app data changes, so does the UI, and conversely.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <h2>Security</h2>
     <p class="angular_features">
       When we talk about enterprise development or transformation to a new leading technology framework, security is the top most concern. And now more than ever enterprises are focusing more on data security, easy access to their channels, distributors and sales team. Certainly, they have to look for a complete solution that can power enterprise processes and business.
     </p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <h2>Declarative User Interface</h2>
     <p class="angular_features">For defining app’s UI AngularJS uses HTML, which is a declarative, intuitive and less convoluted language than defining an interface in JavaScript.
      You should stop spending time on program flows and what loads first, simply define what you need, Angular will deliver the rest.
      </p>
  </li>
   <li>
     <h2>Integration</h2>
     <p class="angular_features">
      It is easy to integrate third party features with AngularJS as Angular integration comes pre-built into frameworks such as Telerik’s Kendo UI, Ionic, Famo.us, Wijmo and others.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <h2>Easy Testing</h2>
     <p class="angular_features">
       The codes written in JavaScript are required to follow a series of tests. As we know that JavaScript is interpreted and dynamic and not compiled.
      </p>
